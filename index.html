					<h3>Ruby Nevers</h3>
					<p>Ruby is a 13 year old Great Pyrenees.  She enjoys pretending that she's a lap dog, at a mere 79 pounds, she has no concept of her weight.  She will lounge all day, waiting patiently for her 'walk' on a leash.  She loves her outdoor space, five and a half acres for her to roam.  The smells of foreign critters initiates her fierce bark. Anything and Everything initiates her bark.</p>

				<h3>Murphy Nevers</h3>
				<p>Murphy is a Ragdoll kitty. He's a polydactyl kitty with EXTRA TOES!!!  He loves his morning routine of going outside to grab a critter to eat (yep, his idea of crunchies...).  He was rescued when he was 4 years old in 2010.  He's not your typical Ragdoll, he is terrified of People.</p>

				<h3>Princess Nevers</h3>
				<p>So, with lack of photos, and just playing around, you all get to see a picture of Princess.  As creepy as this may seem, she is no longer with us. So for the intent of practice, I'm using her. Princess was a pretty tuxedo kitty.  She was 11 years old when she passed of Liver failure (poor baby).  She had the fluffiest tail of any cat I've ever known.  The only girl kitty I've ever owned, she was sort of the mediator of all the boys when they played rough.</p>

				<h3>Macaroni Nevers</h3>
				<p>Uh, Macaroni is the same deal as Princess, he is no longer with us.  Again, due to the lack of finding recent photos of my new-ish, living cats, you all get to meet Macaroni. He was the 'Baby'.  Macaroni was a Super Polydactyl!  That's like a normal poly with extra toes, but with a cape.  He enjoyed playing in boxes, knocking the christmas tree over, and sleeping on my face.  He was one of those asshole ninja kitties that would love you to your face, but try to kill you while you walk down stairs...  He died at 7 years old, but he is still loved.</p>
